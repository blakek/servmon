# servmon
Flexible server monitoring and administration. Hugely in progress

## Requirements
All you have to have to run this software is:
  
  - node.js (with npm) installed and working

## Getting started
First, you'll want to download the node dependencies.  The easiest way is to change to the directory you downloaded this to, and type:
`npm install`

Then, any time you want to start the server, simply type:
`npm start`

If node and npm are working correctly, you should get a message telling you where you can navigate in a browser to actually see what you're running.  You may also simply try opening a browser and navigating to
`http://localhost:4454/`
